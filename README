In this project, I aimed to predict the outcome of cats and dogs in animal shelters.
This classification problem was important to help shelters optimize resources and improve animal welfare, by identifying factors contributing to different outcomes (e.g., adoption, transfer, euthanasia, etc.).

I collected data from several animal shelters, which included variables such as the animal's type (cat or dog), age, breed, color, health condition, and the duration of their stay at the shelter.

I first conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of outcomes and the relationship between the different variables. This helped me identify key factors and patterns that could influence an animal's outcome.

The data underwent preprocessing which included handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and encoding categorical variables. It was then split into training and testing sets.

For the classification task, I experimented with various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Each model was trained using the training set and their performances were compared based on their accuracy on the testing set.

Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using techniques like grid search and cross-validation to optimize the models. The best performing model was selected based on its ability to generalize well to unseen data, its interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Our final model was able to classify the outcomes of animals in shelters with a high degree of accuracy. This model can now be used by shelters to predict the outcome for new animals, allowing them to intervene proactively when necessary, improving the chances of positive outcomes and better resource allocation.
