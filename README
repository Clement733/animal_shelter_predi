👋 Introduction

In this project, our goal was to predict outcomes for cats and dogs in shelters, crucial for optimizing resources and enhancing animal welfare. We meticulously collected diverse data, including type, age, breed, color, health, and shelter duration. After thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify pivotal factors, we preprocessed the data, split it into training and testing sets, and employed various machine learning models for classification, rigorously evaluating their performance. Hyperparameter tuning led to a highly accurate final model, now available to shelters for proactive intervention and improved resource allocation, fostering positive outcomes for shelter animals. 🏆

# Data Analysis

We will first take a look at the data and identify the animals in question.
